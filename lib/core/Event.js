 * @param {String} eventType The event type. This is a textual representation of the kind of event that has occured.
 * @param {Object} eventPayload The data about the event that took place. Most events need some attributes to specify exactly what happened. This is usually a derivative of some action's input parameters.
 * @param {Object} [metadata] Additional key-value pairs, separated from the payload in application processing logic. Usually contains, among others, the actual command parameters that were used to generate this event, for tracing purposes.
 * @param {String} [aggregateID] ID of the originating Aggregate. This is typically omitted when originally creating the event - by default, Aggregates will overwrite this ID in _stageEvent automatically.
 * @param {String} [eventID] The event ID to initialize the event with. Useful when reconstructing events from serialized storage (e.g. a DB).
