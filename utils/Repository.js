 * @param {string} aggregateID ID of the aggregate to load. This indicates to the sink from which stream it should rehydrate the object.
 * @param {function} userFunction The function to perform on the aggregate. It accepts the aggregate object as the sole argument and should return a promise. If a promise is not returned, the function behaves as if an already-resolved promise had been returned.
 * @param {Object} options The options object. See tryWith (from utils) for a detailed listing and description.
 * @returns {external:Promise} a promise that resolves when the user function has resolved and the events are committed to the event sink.
